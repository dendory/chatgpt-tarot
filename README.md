## ChatGPT-Tarot

This is the code behind https://dendory.net/tarot

The files here can be used to create a simple ChatGPT powered static website. It contains 2 parts:

* The script in `script` can be used to select random cards, then get a reading from ChatGPT and populate the readings.json file.
* The static HTML files in `html` can be placed on any public web site, even an S3 bucket, and it will pick a random entry from the JSON file and present it to the viewer. It also contains a number of JPEG files for the cards. Those were created by myself using the Midjourney AI.

Note: Before you can use the script, you need to get your own ChatGPT API key from the OpenAI website and add it in the `get_readings.py` file.
